# tactology-lab-inkdrops

This is a project to play the Korg Volca Beats with water-/inkdrops through an Arduino that sends midi messages to the Volca, for each rain sensor there is also a neopixels that lights up when the sensor is played.

If you want to make this yourself, check out my [Instructable](https://www.instructables.com/Raindrums-With-Lights/)
